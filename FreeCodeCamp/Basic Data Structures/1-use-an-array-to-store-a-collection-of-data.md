# Basic Data Structures: Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data
We have defined a variable called yourArray. Complete the statement by assigning an array of at least 5 elements in length to the yourArray variable. Your array should contain at least one string, one number, and one boolean.
# Solution:
```javascript
let yourArray = ['one', 5, 'two', true, false];
```
